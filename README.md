In this project, I aimed to predict the temperature for a specific location at a glass furnace, at the next timestamp.

In order to do so, a data preprocessing process, followed by a supervised learning model, regression, was needed. 

First of all, Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis processes were held. Needed features are identified.

After that, new features were generated from existing ones.

Then, correlated features and outliers have been removed.

This way, data became ready and experimentation with several regression models began.

Each model has been evaluated with MSE, MAE, and R^2 metrics, and the best model has been chosen.

Finally, hyperparameters of the best model have been fine-tuned.
